Hi

00:00:02.600 --> 00:00:05.100
So this is a demo video

00:00:05.300 --> 00:00:07.100
where I check

00:00:07.180 --> 00:00:10.600
if this subtitle thing that I’m working on 

00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:13.100
works as it should.

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:16.500
So it’s going to be 30 seconds long

00:00:16.600 --> 00:00:18.200
and then

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:19.200
um

00:00:19.300 --> 00:00:22.400
I’ll probably resize it using a tool

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:24.600
so it’s not too big 

00:00:24.700 --> 00:00:27.500
and load it into the app and see.

00:00:27.600 --> 00:00:30.200
So wish me luck.

00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:31.750
Bye
