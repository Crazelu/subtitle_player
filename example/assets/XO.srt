Your love is bright as ever

1
00:00:17,200 --> 00:00:22,800
Even in the shadows

Your heart is glowing

5
00:00:39,900 --> 00:00:45,500
And I'm crashing into you

6
00:00:45,700 --> 00:00:50,000

7
00:00:50,200 --> 00:00:52,900

Baby love me lights out

10
00:00:57,900 --> 00:01:03,600

11
00:01:03,800 --> 00:01:07,700
I'll search through the crowd

12
00:01:07,900 --> 00:01:10,400

You can turn my light down

17
00:01:19,500 --> 00:01:24,800
We don't have forever

18
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:30,000
Baby daylight's wasting

19
00:01:30,200 --> 00:01:34,800
You better kiss me

20
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:42,300
Before our time is run out

21
00:01:42,500 --> 00:01:47,100
Nobody sees what we see

22
00:01:47,300 --> 00:01:52,700
They're just hopelessly gazing

23
00:01:52,900 --> 00:01:57,500
Baby take me

24
00:01:57,700 --> 00:02:00,300

27
00:02:05,700 --> 00:02:11,300
In the darkest night hour

28
00:02:11,500 --> 00:02:15,700
Search through the crowd

29
00:02:15,900 --> 00:02:18,200
